                    <p class="bg-dark">Frank Militello, THE captain 'o captain that started it all. My grandfather is the man that started the longest running tradition that I know of in our family, apart from running late but that wasn't started by a particular person, we all just happen to be good at it. No, he started the annual Wisconsin fishing trip that let us all escape for a week or two and just focus on one thing, enjoying nature together as a family.</p>

                    <p class="bg-dark">This man is someone I look up to a great deal, he has been a formative part of my life for as long as I can remember. From teaching me about "wet cookies", to "bonks" on the forehead, so many sayings, memories, and habits that I am accustomed to are from because I hit the grandfather jackpot. Of course, I share that honor but I'm happy to do it.</p>

                    <p class="bg-dark">As his wife, <a href="../familyPages/grammy.html">Carole</a> can attest, he is also a loving father and husband of 62 years. Being a part of his family means getting the pleasure of hearing all of his great stories. From the beginnings on online banking, to the musings of modern coding languages, he has had a hand in just about everything in some former iteration that we use in the modern world. All the while, helping to raise two children and maintain his fun loving spirit in life.</p>

                    <p class="bg-dark">In addition to all of the previous accolades, he is also a tremendous angler that has kept the love for the sport embedded in our family for several generations, something we will all pass along in the future. Without his tremendous influence, I would not be half the man I am today. Everyday I am grateful to include this incredible man among those that defined who I am as a person and who's company I have the pleasure of keeping on a regular basis.</p>
