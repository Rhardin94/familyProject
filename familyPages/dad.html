When not carrying out his own philosophy, he is literally upholding the laws of the land and sharing those principles with his constituents... and I don't just mean his relatives.</p>

He has always been one half of the foundation that has kept us going through tough times, as well as enjoying the bounty of their joint hard work during the stable moments too.</p>

He supports without judgement, offers his opinion and advice when it's needed, and made sure we always know we can count on him to be there when we need him the most. I am so grateful to have a wonderful role model in my life and I don't know what I would do without him.</p>
