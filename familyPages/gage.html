                    <p>Although he was first introducted to us because of my sister, <a href="../familyPages/kelly.html">Kelly</a>, we found enough similarities between us that we became close friends.</p>

                    <p>Basically, without this man in my life, I would not have had a crucial part of my support system that drove me to pursue my own passions in life and that is something I will be forever grateful for. I will also always appreciate that my sister has found a good man to keep her happy and go on life's misadventures. That being said, if that changes.... I DO know where he lives...</p>
