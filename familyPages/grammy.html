                    <p class="bg-success">Carole Militello is one of the most life-loving, tenacious women out there. There is rarely a moment she isn't smiling about something, or making those around her smile just the same no matter the weather or worry. If you're lucky enough to have a grandmother half as wonderful as mine, you might as well have won the lottery.</p>

                    <p class="bg-success">In addition to providing much needed joy just by being in the room, she is also a tenacious card shark, so if you're looking for a compatriot to crush the competition in euchre, look no further. While her talent brings many-a-game to a close, she will also make sure you enjoy the entire experience. All's fair in love and war, but you won't know the difference because you're just having too much fun.</p>

Her entire family will tell you, myself included, that a hug from this woman is enough to warm your heart for days. While you may not have the pleasure of being a member of her family, friends of hers can experience one in the same... on occasion.</p>

Her kindness is impossibly contagious and helps me carry forward treating others how I want to be treated myself. I feel very sorry for everyone that does not get the pleasure of knowing her, as I KNOW that anyone who does is all the better for it.</p>
