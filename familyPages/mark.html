                    <p class="bg-info">One of my earliest memories of my uncle is, of course, from one of our family trips up to Wisconsin. As a fellow recipient of the family angling lineage, we naturally bonded frequently over our love for the sport. Not only was fishing/Wisconsin a great way to spend a vacation, half of the draw of returning each year was to bond with family in nature and quiet.</p>

                    <p class="bg-info">This man makes family a top priority. Every vacation up until less and less of us were able to go to Wisconsin, he always made sure to leave time to spend with his wife and sons, take them fishing if they wanted, and make the traditional trips into town to explore and enjoy the ambience.</p>

Those bonding times that we've had together over the years just reinforce what a good person my uncle is, and why I am priveliged to be a part of this family. I will never take for granted the fishing trips that sparked many talks about life and answers to questions that I had as we were kept up by the buzzing of hundreds of mosquitos, forcing us to hide under the blankets at 1 in the morning. </p>
