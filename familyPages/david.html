                    <p class="bg-warning">Ever since David came into our lives, he was a happy-go-lucky kinda guy. His first words to me had to be related to Pokemon in some way; as soon as he becomes interested in something he dives head first into learning everything he can about the subject, and he doesn't slack off either. If there were 101 Pokemon when he was first introduced to them, you better believe he knew the names of every single one.</p>

                    <p class="bg-warning">My cousin is also an extremely gifted musical talent. Before he spoke his first words in conversation he was singing and humming his favorite tunes on the school bus. I like to pretend I have an inkling of musicality but I will never come close to this guy. When not singing, he pours his musical drive into the piano. The ivory keys are no joke, and I will always be jealous of his ability to translate his passion for music into his hands.</p>

                    <p class="bg-warning">David is also one of those people who's passion about the things he enjoys bleeds over onto others. His father <a href="../familyPages/mark.html">Mark</a>, mother <a href="../familyPages/patty.html">Patty</a>, and brother <a href="../familyPages/daniel.html">Daniel</a> can probably all attest to this. He is definitely someone that is more than happy to share anything you want to know about the things he enjoys. Have I mentioned Pokemon, because he probably will and you'll love every second of it.</p>
