                    <p class="bg-danger">Nancy Hardin has always been an essential part of the glue that holds our family together. Some of my first memories of her involve trips planned, surprises carried out, and errands run all while my sister and I most likely by her side. She and her husband of soon to be 30 years, <a href="../familyPages/dad.html">Jeff</a> tackled marriage and parenthood with a luster not found in your average couple.</p>

                    <p class="bg-danger">As we made it through the formative years, my mother was and always has been a supportive presence looking over our shoulders to make sure we were okay and not only had everything we needed, but often times strove to provide what everyone wanted as well. She is a people pleaser first and foremost, and almost always puts others' needs above her own.</p>

                    <p class="bg-danger">As testament to her dedication toward others, she could even focus on outward so much to the point that would drive any normal person mad but with a combination of medication and determination she tackles the problems of friends and family head on.</p>

                    <p class="bg-danger">Without my mother, I would not have been able to accomplish even half of what I consider great achievements in my life. With so many people that depend on her dedication and support, I count myself lucky everyday to have the one on one time and support that allowed me to make it this far. From supporting fairly awful hairdos, less than amazing theatrical productions, and of course the rest of the family too, I am extremely fortunate to have a mother half as great as the one I got.</p>
