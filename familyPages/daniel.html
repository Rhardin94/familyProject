                    <p class="bg-dark">Daniel has perhaps the most contagious smile of anyone i've ever met. It isn't something as simple as a family connection, it spreads to everyone around him as soon as the giggles come out and he gets started talking about cars.</p>

                    <p class="bg-dark">Similar to his brother, <a href="../familyPages/david.html">David</a>, Daniel also has a knack for the Piano, perhaps almost one step further as he has a particular affinity toward tones and notes in both music and life in general. If there is a scheduled Westminster Chimes in the area, you can bet he will know about it and be requesting to go hear it live.</p>

                    <p class="bg-dark">Besides his smile and laughter, you can often find Daniel enjoying the fun side of life by telling funny stories and making silly faces (he does have a Hardin/Militello family famous grin). </p>

                    <p class="bg-dark">Once you get a hit of that cheesy grin, and mention Carillon's infront of him, Daniel will have you tearing up from laughter and grinning ear to ear as he tells you about each set of bells he has visited, his goals for future visits, and of course his schematics for the world's largest Carillon set. Daniel is a beautiful soul that is a blessing to his family and all of those around him. Don't forget to enjoy the little things in life, and to talk someone's ear off about your passions once in a while.</p>
